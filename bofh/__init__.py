The bofh library
----------------

The bofh library is an XMLRPC client library for Cerebrum, and the main
component of the pybofh distribution.

This library can be used to automate common use cases of the pybofh cli script.

Typical usage would look something like:

::

    >>> obj = connect('user', 'pass')
    >>> obj.motd
    Message of the day
    >>> obj.user.info('user')
    Username: user
    ...
